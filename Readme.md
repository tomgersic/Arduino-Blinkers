=== LED Runloop Blink
 
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to a digital  
 pin, without using the delay() function.  This means that other code
 can run at the same time without being interrupted by the LED code.
 
 Modified from example code to use classes to be more OOPy
 
 The circuit:
 LEDs attached from pins 10,11,12, and 13 to ground.
